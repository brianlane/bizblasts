## Current Issue Investigation

### Invoice Email Delivery Problem
**Symptom**: Logs show invoice emails being "sent" but Resend dashboard only shows confirmation instruction emails.

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Email Template Rendering Issues**: The invoice template might have rendering errors preventing delivery
2. **Resend API Integration**: There might be an issue with the Resend delivery method configuration
3. **ActionMailer Queue Processing**: SolidQueue might not be processing InvoiceMailer jobs properly
4. **Email Content Filtering**: Resend might be filtering/rejecting invoice emails due to content

**Debugging Steps Implemented**:
- Enhanced logging in ApplicationMailer and InvoiceMailer
- Added delivery method logging
- Improved error handling and backtrace logging

**Next Steps for Investigation**:
1. Check SolidQueue job processing status
2. Verify Resend API configuration and limits
3. Test invoice email rendering in development
4. Check for any Resend content filtering policies

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

### Business Tier Integration
- All business notifications respect tier limitations
- Free tier: Basic functionality only
