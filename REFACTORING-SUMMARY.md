# Booking Functionality Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This refactoring project aimed to modularize the booking functionality for both the base domain and subdomain views, removing code duplication while preserving the existing functionality. The approach was to extract common logic into service classes and shared components, while keeping the domain-specific concerns separate.

## Key Changes

### 1. Backend Service Layer
- Created a new `BookingService` class (`app/services/booking_service.rb`) that encapsulates all booking-related functionality
- The service provides methods for:
  - Generating calendar data for a date range
  - Fetching available time slots
  - Fetching staff availability
  - Managing bookings (create, update, cancel)
  - Checking if a slot is available
- This service acts as a facade over the existing `AvailabilityService` and `BookingManager` classes

### 2. Controller Refactoring
- Refactored the base domain `BookingsController` to use `BookingService`
- Refactored `Public::TenantCalendarController` to use `BookingService`
- Refactored `Public::BookingController` to use `BookingService`
- Refactored `Public::ClientBookingsController` to use `BookingService`
- All these controllers now share the same underlying logic while retaining their specific concerns

### 3. View Sharing
- Created a shared partial `app/views/shared/_available_slots.html.erb` that can be used by both base domain and subdomain views
- Updated views to use this shared partial:
  - `app/views/bookings/available_slots.html.erb`
  - `app/views/public/tenant_calendar/available_slots.html.erb`
- The partial accepts a parameter to indicate whether it's being rendered in a subdomain context

### 4. JavaScript Refactoring
- Created a new JavaScript module `app/javascript/modules/availability_manager.js` to handle availability-related frontend functionality
- Updated the controller `app/javascript/controllers/calendar_controller.js` to use this module
- The module handles:
  - Fetching available slots
  - Determining the appropriate endpoints for base domain or subdomain
  - Formatting dates and times
  - Building URLs for booking actions

### 5. Testing
- Added a new test file `spec/services/booking_service_spec.rb` to verify the functionality of `BookingService`

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common logic is now centralized in the `BookingService` and shared partials.

2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to booking logic can be made in a single place rather than across multiple controllers.

3. **Clearer Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Domain-specific concerns remain in their respective controllers
   - Shared functionality is in service classes
   - View rendering is handled by shared partials

4. **Better Testability**: The service layer is easier to test in isolation.

5. **Consistent Behavior**: Both base domain and subdomain booking flows now use the same underlying logic, ensuring consistent behavior.

## Future Improvements

1. Further refine the JavaScript modules to handle more edge cases

2. Add additional test coverage for the new components

3. Consider extracting more shared functionality into service classes

4. Implement feature flags to enable/disable certain booking features in different contexts
