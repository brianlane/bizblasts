## Technical Debt Strategy Overview

With an ambitious 1-month development timeline and enhanced feature set, BizBlasts will inevitably accumulate technical debt. This document outlines the strategy for managing this debt to ensure long-term maintainability, scalability, and stability of the platform while achieving rapid time-to-market.

## Technical Debt Definition and Classification

### Definition of Technical Debt

For BizBlasts, technical debt is defined as:

1. Code, architecture, or infrastructure decisions that prioritize short-term delivery over long-term maintainability
2. Incomplete implementation of best practices due to time constraints
3. Known limitations or issues accepted for initial launch
4. Documentation gaps created during rapid development
5. Test coverage compromises made to accelerate delivery

### Technical Debt Classification System

All technical debt will be classified using the following framework:

| Category | Description | Impact | Examples |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Critical** | Debt that imposes immediate business risk | High | Security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, data integrity issues |
| **Structural** | Fundamental architecture limitations | Medium-High | Scalability constraints, inadequate separation of concerns, problematic dependencies |
| **Functional** | Limitations in feature implementation | Medium | Manual processes that should be automated, workarounds, feature limitations |
| **Quality** | Gaps in code quality or standards | Medium-Low | Inconsistent coding patterns, duplicate code, inadequate error handling |
| **Knowledge** | Documentation and knowledge gaps | Low-Medium | Missing or outdated documentation, undocumented assumptions |

### Enhanced Feature-Specific Debt Categories

Additional debt categories for the enhanced feature set:

| Feature Area | Description | Impact | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Multi-Location** | Debt related to location management | Medium-High | Cross-location data inconsistencies, location permission gaps, location hierarchy limitations |
| **Forms System** | Debt in conditional form logic | Medium-High | Limited condition types, inefficient rendering, validation inconsistencies |
| **Document System** | Document management limitations | Medium | Unoptimized storage, basic verification workflow, limited document type handling |
| **Resource Management** | Resource allocation limitations | Medium-Low | Simple allocation rules, limited conflict resolution, basic resource types |

### Enhanced Debt Tracking System

All identified technical debt will be tracked in a central repository with the following metadata:

- Debt ID and description
- Category and severity
- Feature area affected (core, multi-location, forms, documents, etc.)
- Estimated remediation effort
- Business impact
- Affected components
- Creation date and author
- Planned resolution timeframe
- Dependencies with other debt items
- Workarounds implemented

## Initial Launch Debt Management for Enhanced Features
