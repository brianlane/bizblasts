```
Section Types:

- product_list (new) → business.products.active
- product_grid (existing) → business.products.active (different layout)

Template Structure:
Home Page:
  - hero_banner (position 0)
  - service_list (position 1) 
  - product_list (position 2) ← NEW
  - testimonial (position 3)
  - contact_form (position 4)

Products Page: ← NEW
  - product_list (position 0)
```

## Development Notes

### 🎯 **Frontend Only**
All changes are in the website builder frontend code as requested
