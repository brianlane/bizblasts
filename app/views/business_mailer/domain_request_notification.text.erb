DOMAIN COST COVERAGE:

Excellent news! As a Premium subscriber, BizBlasts covers domain registration costs up to $20 per year.

What happens next:
• We'll check the cost of your requested domain
• If under $20/year: We handle registration at no cost to you  
• If over $20/year: We'll contact you with alternatives under $20

• You always have the option to use your existing domain

COVERAGE DETAILS: BizBlasts covers domain costs up to $20 per year as part of your Premium subscription. Domains over $20/year require you to obtain your own domain, which you can then connect to your BizBlasts site.

If you already own this domain, you'll continue to handle domain-related costs through your current registrar.

Our team at bizblaststeam@gmail.com will be reaching out to you shortly regarding domain availability and to guide you through the setup process. No action is required on your part at this time.

In the meantime, you can start building your business profile and setting up your services using your temporary subdomain while we work on your custom domain setup.

We appreciate your business and look forward to helping you establish your professional online presence!

Best regards,
The BizBlasts Team
