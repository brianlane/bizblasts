# Memory Optimization Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive memory optimization implementation for the BizBlasts Rails application on Render's platform. The optimizations focus primarily on SolidQueue background job memory usage while also improving overall application memory efficiency.

## Problem Statement
- Rails application hitting 100% memory usage on Render's free tier (512MB limit)
- SolidQueue background jobs were the primary memory consumers
- Application experiencing memory-related crashes and performance issues

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. SolidQueue Configuration Optimization
**File**: `config/initializers/solid_queue.rb`

**Changes**:
- Reduced default concurrency from unlimited to 2 workers
- Configured polling interval to 5-10 seconds (configurable via ENV)
- Set maximum threads per process to 5
- Configured queue-specific concurrency levels:
  - `default`: 1 thread, 1 process
  - `analytics`: 1 thread, 1 process (heavy jobs)
  - `mailers`: 2 threads, 1 process (light jobs)
  - `low_priority`: 1 thread, 1 process
- Added job timeout (5 minutes default)
- Configured automatic cleanup of finished jobs after 7 days
- Optimized database connection pool size for queue workers (3 connections)
- Added forced garbage collection after each job in production

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
SOLID_QUEUE_CONCURRENCY=1
SOLID_QUEUE_POLLING_INTERVAL=10
SOLID_QUEUE_MAX_THREADS=3
SOLID_QUEUE_POOL_SIZE=2
SOLID_QUEUE_JOB_TIMEOUT=300
```

### 2. Database Connection Pool Optimization
**File**: `config/database.yml`

**Changes**:
- Reduced default connection pool from 5 to 3
- Set RAILS_MAX_THREADS to 2 for reduced memory usage

### 3. Background Job Memory Optimization
**Files**: 
- `app/jobs/application_job.rb`
- `app/jobs/analytics_processing_job.rb`

**Changes**:
- Added memory monitoring to all jobs
- Implemented job timeouts to prevent runaway processes
- Added memory threshold checks (400MB limit)
- Implemented batch processing for large datasets
- Reduced default date ranges for analytics jobs (7 days vs 30 days)
- Added forced garbage collection after memory-intensive operations
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added memory-based job discarding for out-of-memory scenarios

### 4. Ruby Garbage Collection Optimization
**File**: `config/initializers/memory_monitoring.rb`

**GC Environment Variables**:
```bash
RUBY_GC_HEAP_INIT_SLOTS=10000
RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS=3000
RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_FACTOR=1.25
RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT=16000000
RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT_MAX=32000000
```

**Features**:
- Configured more aggressive garbage collection
- Added memory monitoring middleware
- Implemented periodic memory reporting
- Added automatic GC triggering at memory thresholds

### 5. Puma Web Server Optimization
**File**: `config/puma.rb`

**Changes**:
- Reduced thread count from 3 to 2
- Set single worker process (WEB_CONCURRENCY=1)
- Disabled request queuing for immediate handling
- Set maximum request size limit (5MB)
- Added memory-conscious worker management
- Optimized SolidQueue plugin loading
- Added nakayoshi_fork for memory optimization

### 6. Render Platform Configuration
**File**: `render.yaml`

**Changes**:
- Removed `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true` to separate concerns
- Added comprehensive memory optimization environment variables
- Set WEB_CONCURRENCY=1 for single worker
- Configured Ruby GC environment variables
- Added option for separate background worker process

### 7. Memory Monitoring and Profiling Tools
**File**: `lib/tasks/memory.rake`

**Features**:
- Memory profiling task (`rails memory:profile`)
- Real-time memory monitoring (`rails memory:monitor`)
- Memory usage testing (`rails memory:test`)
- SolidQueue job cleanup (`rails memory:cleanup_jobs`)

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Memory Monitoring Middleware
- Logs memory usage for each request
- Triggers alerts when memory exceeds thresholds
- Automatically triggers GC when memory is high

### Job-Level Monitoring
- Memory usage logged before and after each job
- Automatic GC for jobs using significant memory
- Job timeout and retry mechanisms

### Rake Tasks for Monitoring
```bash
# Profile current memory usage
rails memory:profile

# Monitor memory usage in real-time
rails memory:monitor

# Test memory usage of operations
rails memory:test

# Clean up old jobs
rails memory:cleanup_jobs
```

## Environment Variables Reference

### Core Settings
```bash
RAILS_MAX_THREADS=2
WEB_CONCURRENCY=1

SOLID_QUEUE_MAX_THREADS=3
SOLID_QUEUE_POOL_SIZE=2
SOLID_QUEUE_JOB_TIMEOUT=300
SOLID_QUEUE_CLEAR_JOBS_AFTER=604800  # 7 days in seconds
```

### Ruby GC Settings

RUBY_GC_HEAP_INIT_SLOTS=10000
RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS=3000
RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_FACTOR=1.25
RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_MAX_SLOTS=5000

```

## Expected Memory Usage Improvements

### Before Optimization
- Memory usage: 450-512MB (hitting limits)
- Frequent OOM crashes
- SolidQueue workers consuming excessive memory

### After Optimization
- Expected memory usage: 200-350MB
- Reduced crash frequency
- More efficient job processing
- Better memory reclamation

## Troubleshooting Guide

### High Memory Usage
1. Check memory monitoring logs
2. Run `rails memory:profile` to identify issues
3. Use `rails memory:monitor` for real-time tracking
4. Check SolidQueue job queue sizes

### Job Performance Issues
1. Monitor job completion times in logs
2. Adjust SOLID_QUEUE_CONCURRENCY if needed
3. Check for failed jobs accumulation
4. Run `rails memory:cleanup_jobs` to clear old jobs

### Database Connection Issues
1. Monitor connection pool usage
2. Adjust SOLID_QUEUE_POOL_SIZE if needed
3. Check for connection leaks in logs

## Deployment Checklist

1. ✅ Update environment variables in Render dashboard
2. ✅ Deploy updated configuration files
3. ✅ Monitor memory usage after deployment
4. ✅ Test background job processing
5. ✅ Verify memory monitoring is working
6. ✅ Schedule regular job cleanup

## Optional: Separate Worker Process

If memory usage is still high, consider uncommenting the worker service in `render.yaml`:

```yaml
- type: worker
  name: bizblasts-worker
  env: ruby
  buildCommand: "./bin/render-build.sh"
  startCommand: "bundle exec rails solid_queue:start"
  # ... environment variables
```

This will run background jobs in a completely separate process from the web server.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor application performance for 24-48 hours
2. Adjust environment variables based on actual usage patterns
3. Consider upgrading Render plan if memory optimization isn't sufficient
4. Implement additional job batching for large operations
5. Consider caching strategies to reduce database queries
