## Key Debugging & Fixes Applied

### System Test Setup Issues Fixed âœ…
- **Problem**: System tests were hitting routing errors instead of actual pages
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect subdomain and authentication setup
- **Solution**: Applied proper patterns from existing codebase:
  - Used `include_context 'setup business context'` for business manager tests
  - Used `login_as(manager, scope: :user)` for authentication
  - Used `switch_to_subdomain(business.subdomain)` for proper routing
  - Called `Rails.application.reload_routes!` after subdomain switch

### Migration Default Value Issue Fixed âœ…
- **Problem**: Existing tests failing because migration changed default value
- **Solution**: Updated existing test to explicitly set `tips_enabled: false` for proper isolation
