## ‚úÖ Fix 3: Rate Limiting Implementation
**Status: COMPLETED**
**Priority: HIGH**
**Files: `Gemfile`, `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb`, `config/application.rb`**

### Changes Made:
- **ADDED** `rack-attack` gem dependency
- **CONFIGURED** comprehensive rate limiting rules:
  - Contact form: 5 requests/hour per IP
  - Search requests: 60 requests/minute per IP
  - Login attempts: 10 attempts/5 minutes per IP
  - Registration: 5 attempts/hour per IP
  - Cart operations: 30 requests/minute per IP
  - Password resets: 5 requests/hour per IP
  - General traffic: 300 requests/5 minutes per IP
- **IMPLEMENTED** custom response for rate-limited requests
- **ADDED** comprehensive logging for blocked requests
- **CONFIGURED** Redis support for production environments

### Security Impact:
- Prevents brute force attacks on authentication
- Mitigates DDoS and DoS attacks
- Protects against automated abuse of forms and APIs
- Provides detailed attack monitoring and logging

---

## ‚úÖ Fix 4: Session Security Configuration
**Status: COMPLETED**
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**File: `config/environments/development.rb`**

### Changes Made:
- **REPLACED** insecure `domain: :all` with environment-specific domains
- **ADDED** `httponly: true` to prevent JavaScript access to session cookies
- **IMPLEMENTED** `secure: true` for production environments
- **CONFIGURED** `same_site: :lax` for CSRF protection
- **SPECIFIED** appropriate domain scoping (lvh.me for dev, .bizblasts.com for production)

### Security Impact:
- Prevents session hijacking via XSS
- Implements CSRF protection via SameSite attribute
- Ensures session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS in production
- Restricts session scope to appropriate domains

---

## ‚úÖ Fix 5: File Upload Security Enhancement
**Status: COMPLETED**
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**File: `config/initializers/file_upload_security.rb`**

### Changes Made:
- **CREATED** centralized `FileUploadSecurity` module
- **STANDARDIZED** allowed file types and size limits
- **IMPLEMENTED** comprehensive upload logging
- **ADDED** security event monitoring for large files
- **PREPARED** infrastructure for virus scanning integration
- **ENHANCED** existing model validations with centralized security logging

### Security Impact:
- Prevents malicious file uploads
- Implements consistent security policies across all upload endpoints
- Provides detailed logging for forensic analysis
- Establishes foundation for virus scanning integration

---

## ‚úÖ Fix 6: Production Debug Information Removal
**Status: COMPLETED**
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**File: `config/environments/production.rb`**

### Changes Made:
- **REMOVED** debug output that exposed:
  - Database configuration details
  - Environment variable presence/absence
  - SECRET_KEY_BASE status
  - RAILS_MASTER_KEY status
  - Database connection strings
- **CLEANED** production startup logs

### Security Impact:
- Eliminates information disclosure in production logs
- Prevents exposure of sensitive configuration details
- Reduces attack surface for reconnaissance

---

## ‚úÖ Fix 7: Comprehensive Security Logging
**Status: COMPLETED**
**Priority: LOW**
**File: `config/initializers/security_logging.rb`**

### Changes Made:
- **IMPLEMENTED** `SecurityLogging` module with standardized event logging
- **ADDED** authentication event logging (login success/failure)
- **CONFIGURED** authorization failure logging
- **IMPLEMENTED** data access logging for sensitive resources
- **ADDED** configuration change logging
- **INTEGRATED** with Devise authentication system
- **ENHANCED** Pundit authorization with security logging
- **IMPLEMENTED** sensitive data masking in logs

### Security Impact:
- Provides comprehensive audit trail for security events
- Enables rapid incident response and forensic analysis
- Implements compliance-ready logging for authentication and authorization
- Facilitates monitoring of suspicious activity patterns

## üõ°Ô∏è Overall Security Posture Improvement

### Before Implementation:
- **HIGH RISK**: Permissive CSP allowing inline scripts and eval
- **HIGH RISK**: Information disclosure via health checks
- **HIGH RISK**: No rate limiting protection
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Insecure session configuration
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Debug information exposure
- **LOW RISK**: Limited security logging

### After Implementation:
