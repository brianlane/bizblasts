- `find_optimal_booking_time`: Determines best booking time based on preferences
- `determine_optimal_staff_member`: Selects staff using priority hierarchy
- `find_same_day_next_month`: Implements same-day-next-month logic
- `handle_booking_fallback`: Manages fallback scenarios

**Preference Hierarchy:**
1. **Preferred Staff Member**: Customer's selected staff member
2. **Qualified Staff**: Staff members who can perform the service
3. **Any Available Staff**: Fallback to any available staff member

**Fallback Strategies:**
- **Same Day Next Month**: Find soonest available slot
- **Loyalty Points**: Award compensation points if loyalty enabled
- **Business Default**: Use business-specific fallback rules

### 2. Advanced Stock Management Service

The enhanced services support additional email notifications:

**For Scheduling Issues:**
- `booking_unavailable`: When no slots are available
- `loyalty_compensation_awarded`: When loyalty points are awarded instead

**For Stock Issues:**
- `partial_fulfillment`: When only partial stock is available
- `product_substitution`: When products are substituted
- `month_skipped`: When billing cycle is skipped
