## Current Issue Investigation

### Invoice Email Delivery Problem
**Symptom**: Logs show invoice emails being "sent" but Resend dashboard only shows confirmation instruction emails.

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Email Template Rendering Issues**: The invoice template might have rendering errors preventing delivery
2. **Resend API Integration**: There might be an issue with the Resend delivery method configuration
3. **ActionMailer Queue Processing**: SolidQueue might not be processing InvoiceMailer jobs properly
4. **Email Content Filtering**: Resend might be filtering/rejecting invoice emails due to content

**Debugging Steps Implemented**:
- Enhanced logging in ApplicationMailer and InvoiceMailer
- Added delivery method logging
- Improved error handling and backtrace logging

**Next Steps for Investigation**:
1. Check SolidQueue job processing status
2. Verify Resend API configuration and limits
3. Test invoice email rendering in development
4. Check for any Resend content filtering policies

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
- `MAILER_EMAIL`: From address for all emails
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Support contact email
- Resend API credentials (already configured)

### Business Tier Integration
- All business notifications respect tier limitations
- Free tier: Basic functionality only
- Standard/Premium: Full notification features
- Preference checking prevents unauthorized notifications

### Database Changes
- Enhanced notification_preferences JSONB fields for both User models
- Proper validation and controller parameter handling

## Benefits Delivered

### For Businesses
- Real-time notifications of customer activity
- Comprehensive payment and booking tracking
- Customer engagement insights
- Professional email templates maintain brand image
- Granular control over notification preferences

### For Customers  
- Improved email preference management
- Better organized notification categories
- Professional email experience
- Consistent branding across all communications

### For Platform
- Enhanced logging for email debugging
- Scalable notification system
- Tier-based feature restrictions
- Professional email templates

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Email Delivery**: Verify all email types reach recipients
2. **Test Preference Controls**: Ensure notification preferences properly filter emails
3. **Test Tier Restrictions**: Verify free tier limitations work correctly
4. **Test Error Handling**: Ensure email failures don't break core functionality
5. **Test Template Rendering**: Verify all email templates render correctly across email clients

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor email delivery rates in Resend dashboard
- Watch for email-related errors in application logs
- Periodically review email open rates and engagement
- Update email templates based on user feedback
- Maintain tier-based restrictions as business model evolves 

## Production Deployment

### SolidQueue Configuration

The email notification system is configured to work reliably in production using **SolidQueue in Puma**:

#### SolidQueue in Puma (Recommended for Single Server)
- Enabled via `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true` environment variable
- Runs background jobs within the main web process using the SolidQueue Puma plugin
- Eliminates need for separate worker processes
- Suitable for email notification workloads (lightweight, infrequent jobs)
- Simpler deployment with single service
- No additional service costs

### Production Environment Variables Required

The following environment variables must be configured in production:
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: API key for Resend email service
- `MAILER_EMAIL`: Default from email address
- `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA`: Set to "true" to enable background job processing
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (auto-configured by Render)

### How It Works

1. **Puma starts** with the `solid_queue` plugin enabled
2. **SolidQueue supervisor** runs within the Puma process
3. **Email jobs** are processed in background threads
4. **Web requests** continue to be handled normally
5. **Jobs and web traffic** share the same process but run in separate threads

### Email Delivery Verification

To verify email delivery in production:
1. Monitor SolidQueue job status via Rails console or logs
2. Check Resend dashboard for email delivery status
3. Review application logs for email-related errors
4. Test with actual guest bookings to confirm end-to-end functionality

### Debugging Failed Jobs

#### ActiveAdmin Interface (Recommended)
Access the comprehensive job monitoring interface via ActiveAdmin:
1. **Navigate to**: `/admin/solid_queue_jobs` 
2. **View Dashboard**: Job statistics, recent jobs, failed jobs, and email-specific monitoring
3. **Retry Jobs**: Individual or bulk retry failed jobs with one click
4. **Monitor Status**: Real-time job status with color-coded indicators

#### Rails Console Access
Access failed jobs in production via Rails console:
```ruby
# Check for failed email jobs
SolidQueue::FailedExecution.joins(:job)
  .where('solid_queue_jobs.class_name = ?', 'ActionMailer::MailDeliveryJob')
  .each { |f| puts f.error }

# Retry failed jobs
SolidQueue::FailedExecution.find_each(&:retry)
```

#### Features of ActiveAdmin Interface
- **Job Statistics Dashboard**: Visual overview of all job types and statuses
- **Recent Jobs Table**: Latest 10 jobs with status indicators
- **Failed Jobs Management**: Detailed error messages with retry functionality  
- **Email Job Monitoring**: Dedicated section for email-related jobs
- **One-Click Actions**: Retry individual jobs or all failed jobs at once
- **Integrated Navigation**: Accessible from main admin dashboard

### Scaling Considerations

If you later need to scale beyond single-server deployment:
- Remove `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true`
- Add dedicated worker services in `render.yaml`
- Use `bundle exec bin/jobs start` as worker start command
