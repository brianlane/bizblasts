# Email Architecture Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

Fixed the ActionMailer `deliver_later` error that occurred when using `StaggeredEmailService`:

```
You've accessed the message before asking to deliver it later, so you may have made local changes that would be silently lost if we enqueued a job to deliver it. Why? Only the mailer method arguments are passed with the delivery job! Do not access the message in any way if you mean to deliver it later.
```

## Additional Issue Fixed

**Multi-Tenant Background Job Context Issue**: Fixed the related error where background jobs couldn't find tenant-scoped models:

```
Error while trying to deserialize arguments: Couldn't find TenantCustomer with 'id'=11
```

This occurred because background jobs lost the business tenant context when executing in SolidQueue workers.

## Root Cause

The original `StaggeredEmailService` was storing `ActionMailer::MessageDelivery` objects and checking them with `.present?`, which internally accessed the message object. Once accessed, Rails prevents using `deliver_later` because it can only serialize method arguments, not message state.

The tenant context issue occurred because `TenantCustomer` models use `acts_as_tenant(:business)`, and background jobs run without the business context that was present when the job was enqueued.

## Solution Architecture

Implemented a new email specification-based architecture that stores email "recipes" instead of email objects and preserves tenant context:

### 1. EmailSpecification Class (`app/services/email_specification.rb`)

- **Purpose**: Stores mailer class, method name, and arguments instead of mailer objects
- **Key Features**:
  - Immutable and thread-safe (frozen after creation)
  - Supports conditional execution via callable conditions
  - Validates mailer class and method existence at creation time
  - Defers email object creation until delivery time
  - **Automatic tenant context preservation and restoration**
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

```ruby
spec = EmailSpecification.new(
  mailer_class: BusinessMailer,
  method_name: :new_customer_notification,
  arguments: [tenant_customer],  # Automatically extracts business context
  condition: -> { some_condition? }  # Optional
)

spec.execute  # Creates and delivers email with proper tenant context
spec.execute_with_delay(wait: 5.seconds)  # Same but with delay
```

### 2. Tenant Context Management

The `EmailSpecification` class automatically:

- **Extracts business context** from tenant-scoped model arguments during initialization
- **Preserves the business tenant** even when `ActsAsTenant.current_tenant` changes
- **Restores tenant context** when executing in background jobs using `ActsAsTenant.with_tenant`

```ruby
# Example: This works even in background jobs without tenant context
spec = EmailSpecification.new(
  mailer_class: BusinessMailer,
  method_name: :new_customer_notification,
  arguments: [tenant_customer]  # Business context automatically captured
)

# Later, in background job (no tenant context)
ActsAsTenant.current_tenant = nil
spec.execute  # Still works! Tenant context is restored automatically
```

### 3. EmailCollectionBuilder Class (`app/services/email_collection_builder.rb`)

- **Purpose**: Provides a fluent interface for building collections of email specifications
- **Key Features**:
  - Fluent/chainable API for easy composition
  - Helper methods for common scenarios (orders, bookings)
  - Built-in conditional logic for customer notifications
  - Declarative email specification building
  - **Automatic tenant context preservation** for all specifications

```ruby
specs = EmailCollectionBuilder.new
  .add_email(BusinessMailer, :new_order_notification, [order])
  .add_conditional_email(
    mailer_class: BusinessMailer,
    method_name: :new_customer_notification,
    args: [customer],
    condition: -> { customer_newly_created?(customer) }
  )
  .build
```

### 4. Enhanced StaggeredEmailService (`app/services/staggered_email_service.rb`)

- **Purpose**: Handles staggered email delivery using the new specification architecture
- **Key Features**:
  - New `deliver_specifications` method for the new architecture
  - Backward compatibility with legacy `deliver_multiple` method (deprecated)
  - Multiple delivery strategies (immediate, time-staggered, batch-staggered)
  - Comprehensive error handling and success tracking
  - Rate limiting support for email service providers
  - **Full tenant context support** for background job execution

```ruby
# New architecture
email_specs = EmailCollectionBuilder.new.add_order_emails(order).build
StaggeredEmailService.deliver_specifications(email_specs)

# Helper methods
StaggeredEmailService.deliver_order_emails(order)
StaggeredEmailService.deliver_booking_emails(booking)

# Advanced strategies
StaggeredEmailService.deliver_with_strategy(
  email_specs, 
  strategy: :batch_staggered, 
  batch_size: 5, 
  batch_delay: 3.seconds
)
```

## Key Benefits

## Usage Examples

### Basic Email Specification
```ruby
spec = EmailSpecification.new(
  mailer_class: BusinessMailer,
  method_name: :new_order_notification,
  arguments: [order]
)
spec.execute  # Delivers immediately with proper tenant context
```

### Conditional Email with Tenant Context
```ruby
spec = EmailSpecification.new(
  mailer_class: BusinessMailer,
  method_name: :new_customer_notification,
  arguments: [tenant_customer],  # Business context automatically captured
  condition: -> { customer.created_at > 10.seconds.ago }
)
spec.execute  # Only executes if condition is true, with proper tenant context
```

### Order Email Collection
```ruby
# Automatically includes order notification, conditional customer notification, and invoice email
# All with proper tenant context preservation
StaggeredEmailService.deliver_order_emails(order)
```

### Custom Email Collection
```ruby
specs = EmailCollectionBuilder.new
  .add_email(BusinessMailer, :payment_received, [payment])
  .add_conditional_email(
    mailer_class: CustomerMailer,
    method_name: :payment_confirmation,
    args: [payment],
    condition: -> { payment.amount > 100 }
  )
  .build

StaggeredEmailService.deliver_specifications(specs)
```

## Tenant Context Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Order Creation with Customer Notification
```ruby
# When order is created, tenant context is captured
order = Order.create!(business: business, tenant_customer: tenant_customer, ...)

# Email specifications are built with tenant context
email_specs = EmailCollectionBuilder.new.add_order_emails(order).build

# Background jobs execute with restored tenant context
StaggeredEmailService.deliver_specifications(email_specs)
# ✅ No "Couldn't find TenantCustomer" errors
```

### Scenario 2: Manual Email Specification
```ruby
# Even when manually creating specifications outside tenant context
ActsAsTenant.current_tenant = nil

spec = EmailSpecification.new(
  mailer_class: BusinessMailer,
  method_name: :new_customer_notification,
  arguments: [tenant_customer]  # Business context extracted from customer
)

# This works in background jobs
spec.execute  # ✅ Tenant context restored automatically
```

## Migration Strategy

The implementation provides full backward compatibility:

1. **Immediate**: New order/booking creation automatically uses the new architecture with tenant context support
2. **Gradual**: Existing code using `deliver_multiple` continues to work with deprecation warnings
3. **Future**: Can gradually migrate other email scenarios to use the new architecture

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Eliminates premature message object creation
- **Minimal**: Specification objects are lightweight
- **Improved**: Better error handling prevents email delivery failures
- **Tenant Context**: Minimal overhead for context extraction and restoration

## Monitoring

The new architecture includes comprehensive logging:
- Email specification creation and validation
- Tenant context extraction and restoration
- Execution success/failure tracking
- Rate limiting and delay information
- Clear error messages for debugging

## Future Enhancements

The architecture is designed to support:
- Queue integration with SolidQueue
- Advanced rate limiting strategies
- Email delivery monitoring and alerting
- Template-based email specifications
- Retry logic for failed deliveries
- Enhanced multi-tenant support features

## Conclusion

This fix resolves both the immediate ActionMailer issue and the multi-tenant background job context problem while providing a robust, scalable foundation for email delivery in the application. The new architecture is more maintainable, testable, and flexible than the previous implementation, with comprehensive tenant context support that eliminates serialization errors in background jobs.
