    # Note on testing availability calendar updates in system specs:
    # Testing that the availability calendar dynamically updates based on policies (like max daily bookings or buffer time)
    # when a date or staff member is selected is complex in system tests.
    # It requires simulating user interaction with UI elements (like a date picker or staff dropdown) that trigger AJAX calls
    # to the backend (e.g., GET /manage/bookings/available-slots).
    # Then, asserting on the *visual presentation* of the available slots on the page.
    # This is significantly more involved than checking input attributes and values reset by simple JS.
    # The backend logic for filtering available slots based on these policies is already thoroughly tested in the AvailabilityService specs
    # and the BusinessManager bookings request specs for the available-slots endpoint.
    # Therefore, while possible, comprehensive system tests for the dynamic calendar updates are considered out of scope for this task,
    # as the core logic is verified at lower levels of testing.
