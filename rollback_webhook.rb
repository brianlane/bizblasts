puts "ðŸ“‹ ROLLBACK INSTRUCTIONS"
puts "========================="
puts
puts "If the new webhook URL (www.bizblasts.com) causes issues:"
puts
puts "1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming"
puts "2. Click on phone number: (855) 612-8814"
puts "3. Change webhook URL back to:"
puts "   https://bizblasts.com/webhooks/twilio/inbound"
puts "4. Save the configuration"
puts
puts "Note: Rolling back will restore the redirect issue, but ensures"
puts "no other functionality is broken."
puts
puts "ðŸ“‹ ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS"
puts "========================"
puts
puts "Instead of rollback, consider these alternatives:"
puts
puts "1. FIX REDIRECT: Configure your server to NOT redirect bizblasts.com"
puts "   - This is the best long-term solution"
puts "   - Allows using the original webhook URL"
puts
puts "2. SIGNATURE DISABLED: Temporarily disable webhook signature verification"
puts "   - Set TWILIO_VERIFY_SIGNATURES=false in environment variables"
puts "   - This allows testing but reduces security"
puts
puts "3. CUSTOM DOMAIN: Use a different domain that doesn't redirect"
puts "   - Configure webhook to use api.bizblasts.com or similar"
puts
puts "Current recommended approach: Keep www.bizblasts.com webhook URL"
puts "This is the simplest and most reliable solution."
